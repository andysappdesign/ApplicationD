Emily Blunt gave a belivable performance she is not just Mary Poppins (from Mary Poppins Returns), but she gave a hint of her original character by bring her witty attiude and old school English accent. \n\nThe Rock, aka, Maui from 2016's Moana, completly was not Maui, but did replicate his character from Jumangi. However the film's acticting was really won by Jack Whitehall who was brilliantly funny in his real debut in Disney."
